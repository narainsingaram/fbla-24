## Prompt:
Create a program that allows your school’s Career and Technical Education Department to
collect and store information about local business and community partners. This program
should include information on at least 25 different partners, with details such as, but not
limited to, type of organization, resources available, and direct contact information for an
individual. The program should enable users to search and filter the information as needed.


- had ideas on incorporating an ai and basically a user can send a prompt about the data they are looking for and it would provide the specific information in terms of text for it.

- make the search more advanced where the user can search for specific fields.
- also give user the ability to order the results based on lowest to highest in terms of a field

- PDF Reports: Generate printable PDF reports summarizing partner information for offline use or presentations.

- also need to work on data validation such as what to show when no results show up and error validations

- Interactive Map Integration? because we get to statically choose the 25 businesses maybe there is a way we can integrate google maps or some map software to display to the user?

- Pagination: If you have a large number of partners, implement pagination to split the list into manageable pages, improving performance and user experience.

- Accessibility Features: Implement accessibility standards to ensure the app is usable by people with disabilities.

- Translation and Localization: Offer multiple language support and localization options to cater to diverse users.


- Also include the logos of the acutal companies/communities

- and improve the ui using a nuxt tempalte possibly?

- BE able to export search results as a csv or pdf

- ABILITY to have lazy loading of content with skeletons
